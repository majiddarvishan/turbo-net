Reduced Context Switching
Asio’s strand abstraction (asio::strand) allows you to serialize access to shared data without a mutex. That means fewer locks and context switches compared to a naïve per-socket thread or mutex-heavy design.

Zero-Copy Support
When you combine Asio’s buffer sequences with scatter/gather system calls (e.g., writev / readv), you can send or receive multiple buffers in a single syscall, further cutting down on kernel transitions.

Asynchronous Composability
Asio’s asynchronous model encourages chaining and composing operations (e.g. async_read_until, async_write) so you avoid “callback hell” and keep the I/O flow linear. Fewer bugs and lower latencies in your application logic translate to better throughput overall.
